# Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare: Drug Safety

I completed this project through DataCamp using Python and libraries NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

### Content
- `drug_safety.csv` is the dataset used for this project
- `drug_safety.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook

### Abstract
This project investigates the transparency and reproducibility of a newly developed drug by a pharmaceutical company. Using data provided by Hbiostat, I aimed to assess the statistical significance of adverse reactions, such as headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, and chronic obstructive airway disease, in conjunction with demographic data, vital signs, and lab measures. The goal of the project is to determine the prevalence of adverse effects among participants receiving the drug compared to those receiving a placebo through hypothesis testing. This analysis will provide valuable insight into the drug's safety profile, which is very important in healthcare decision-making.
